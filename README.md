#  Tesla Model Y Configurator – Full Functional Clone

> Built as a guided project to learn UI logic, dynamic pricing, and feature toggling — using pure HTML, Tailwind CSS & JavaScript.

This is **not** just a UI template — this clone replicates Tesla’s car configurator logic step-by-step.  
From selecting exterior colors to advanced upgrades like Full-Self Driving — everything changes the final price dynamically.
